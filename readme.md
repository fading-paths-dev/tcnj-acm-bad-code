# TCNJ ACM: Bad Code Challenge, Apollo Fixes

> A re-structured program that outputs the letters of the English alphabet in a random order.

## Background

The College of New Jersey's ACM chapter asked each attendee of a recent meeting to write a program that outputs the letters of the English alphabet in a random order and make the program's code as awful and unmaintainable as possible.

Apollo Fire Ltd asked its engineers to improve the code to meet the following requirements:
- As a software manager I want you to improve the quality of the provided code so that it is easier to understand
- As a software manager I want you to improve the quality of the provided code so that it is easier to maintain
- As a customer I want you to demonstrate that the functionality of the provided code has not been degraded so that I can be confident that my projects using the code will not be broken

This repository is the result.



## Usage

```sh
$ python3 bad.py
```
